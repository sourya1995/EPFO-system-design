## Integration Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. API Design Standards

#### RESTful API Guidelines
```yaml
API_Standards:
  versioning:
    strategy: "URL versioning"
    format: "/api/v1/endpoint"
    backward_compatibility: "Maintain for 2 versions"
  
  authentication:
    method: "OAuth 2.0 + JWT"
    token_expiry: "1 hour"
    refresh_token: "30 days"
    rate_limiting: "Per client limits"
  
  response_format:
    success_format:
      status: "success"
      data: "Response data"
      metadata: "Additional info"
    
    error_format:
      status: "error"
      error_code: "Specific error code"
      message: "Human readable message"
      details: "Technical details"
  
  http_status_codes:
    - 200: "Success"
    - 201: "Created"
    - 400: "Bad Request"
    - 401: "Unauthorized"
    - 403: "Forbidden"
    - 404: "Not Found"
    - 429: "Rate Limited"
    - 500: "Internal Server Error"
```

### 2. Message Queue Integration

#### Asynchronous Processing
```yaml
Message_Queue_Pattern:
  queue_system: "Apache Kafka / RabbitMQ"
  
  message_types:
    - command_messages: "Execute specific actions"
    - event_messages: "Notify about events"
    - document_messages: "Process documents"
    - notification_messages: "Send notifications"
  
  queue_configuration:
    - dead_letter_queue: "Handle failed messages"
    - retry_mechanism: "Exponential backoff"
    - message_ordering: "Maintain order if required"
    - durability: "Persist messages"
  
  processing_patterns:
    - publish_subscribe: "One-to-many messaging"
    - request_response: "Synchronous-like behavior"
    - competing_consumers: "Load distribution"
    - message_routing: "Route based on content"
```

### 3. Error Handling and Resilience

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```yaml
Circuit_Breaker:
  configuration:
    failure_threshold: 5
    timeout: 60_seconds
    recovery_timeout: 300_seconds
  
  states:
    - closed: "Normal operation"
    - open: "Failing fast"
    - half_open: "Testing recovery"
  
  fallback_strategies:
    - cached_response: "Return cached data"
    - default_response: "Return default values"
    - alternative_service: "Use backup service"
    - graceful_degradation: "Reduced functionality"
```

#### Retry Mechanisms
```yaml
Retry_Strategy:
  exponential_backoff:
    initial_delay: 1_second
    max_delay: 60_seconds
    multiplier: 2
    max_attempts: 5
  
  retry_conditions:
    - network_timeout: "Retry on timeout"
    - server_error: "Retry on 5xx errors"
    - rate_limit: "Retry after delay"
    - temporary_failure: "Retry on temp failures"
  
  non_retry_conditions:
    - authentication_error: "Don't retry 401"
    - authorization_error: "Don't retry 403"
    - bad_request: "Don't retry 400"
    - not_found: "Don't retry 404"
```

### 4. Monitoring and Observability

#### Integration Monitoring
```yaml
Monitoring_Strategy:
  metrics:
    - request_count: "Number of API calls"
    - response_time: "API response times"
    - error_rate: "Error percentage"
    - throughput: "Requests per second"
    - availability: "Service uptime"
  
  alerting:
    - high_error_rate: "Error rate > 5%"
    - slow_response: "Response time > 5s"
    - service_down: "Service unavailable"
    - rate_limit_hit: "Rate limit exceeded"
  
  logging:
    - request_logs: "All API requests"
    - error_logs: "Error details"
    - performance_logs: "Performance metrics"
    - audit_logs: "Security events"
  
  tracing:
    - distributed_tracing: "End-to-end tracing"
    - correlation_ids: "Request correlation"
    - span_analysis: "Performance analysis"
    - dependency_mapping: "Service dependencies"
```

This comprehensive integration plan ensures seamless connectivity with all necessary external systems while maintaining security, reliability, and performance standards.
